This is the *Recipe Management System* project I made myself.

**Overview:**
- Multi-user web service using Spring Boot for recipe management.
- Features CRUD operations, PostgreSQL database storage, and Spring Boot Security.

**Technologies Used:**
- Spring Boot
- Project Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code and improves readability.
- PostgreSQL
- Spring Boot Security: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- Java Persistence API (JPA): Object-relational mapping for database interaction.
- Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access using JPA in Spring applications.
- RESTful API Design: Design principles for creating scalable and maintainable APIs.

**Key Contributions:**
- Implemented endpoints for adding, updating, and retrieving recipes.
- Integrated PostgreSQL database for persistent recipe storage.
- Added sorting and search functionalities based on category and name.
- Implemented user registration and secured endpoints with Spring Boot Security.
